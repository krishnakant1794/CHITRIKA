#A full-stack web application named Chitrika is my freelancing e-commerce project. I built this project for my client, who is a painter/artist. She sells her paintings (modern art, resin art, cloth art, and canvas art). Users can securely log in through Firebase Authentication, browse and add paintings to their cart, then proceed to the checkout page to pay safely via Razorpay, which supports all payment types. Once payment is successful, the final order is placed. An admin page is also provided to view the latest orders received along with customer details, and orders are delivered within 5â€“6 days across India.
